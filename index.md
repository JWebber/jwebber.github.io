## About Me

<b>The <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ukhydrogels/">UK Hydrogels Network</a> now has a website - join the <a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?SUBED1=HYDROGELS&A=1">hydrogels mailing list</a> for researchers working on hydrogels in the UK to stay up-to-date.</b>

I am a research fellow at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths">Warwick Mathematics Institute</a> at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/">University of Warwick</a>, working in the group of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/montenegro-johnson/">Professor Tom Montenegro-Johnson</a> on the Leverhulme-funded project <i>Shape Transforming Active Matter</i>. Before this, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://damtp.cam.ac.uk">Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics</a> at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/mgw1">Professor Grae Worster</a>. My PhD thesis, entitled <i>Dynamics of super-absorbent hydrogels</i>, is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.109003">here</a>.

I'm an applied mathematician working at the interface between fluid mechanics and soft matter, specifically studying poroelasticity (the behaviour of porous, deformable media). I have a particular interest in hydrogels, soft elastic solids formed of a polymer matrix surrounded by water molecules, and their swelling and drying behaviour. The publications below or my <a href="/assets/files/cv.pdf">CV</a> show more details on what I've been working on, but don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:joe.webber@warwick.ac.uk">get in touch</a> if you have any questions.
