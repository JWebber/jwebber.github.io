## About Me

I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://damtp.cam.ac.uk">Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics</a> at the University of Cambridge, supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/mgw1">Professor Grae Worster</a>.

I'm an applied mathematician working at the interface between fluid mechanics and soft matter, specifically studying poroelasticity (the behaviour of porous, deformable media). I have a particular interest in hydrogels, soft elastic solids formed of a polymer matrix surrounded by water molecules, and their swelling and drying behaviour. The publications below or my <a href="/assets/files/cv_redacted.pdf">CV</a> show more details on what I've been working on, but don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:j.webber@damtp.cam.ac.uk">get in touch</a> if you have any questions.
