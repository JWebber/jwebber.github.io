    abstract: "Thermo-responsive hydrogels are smart materials that can rapidly switch between hydrophilic (swollen) and hydrophobic (shrunken) states when heated past a threshold temperature. This switch results in order-of-magnitude changes in gel volume, allowing for the construction of microfluidic devices or smart actuators. However, modelling thermo-responsive hydrogels is difficult, and typically involves fitting a large number of material parameters to tune the model to experimental data. In this paper, we extend the intuitive and inherently macroscopic linear-elastic-nonlinear-swelling (LENS) model of Webber and Worster (<i>J. Fluid Mech</i>, vol. 96, 2023, A37) to incorporate thermo-responsivity. We show how temperature affects the osmotic pressure of a gel and therefore modifies the equilibrium polymer fraction. Using this model, we then consider hollow tubes of thermo-responsive hydrogel immersed in water, which deswell when heated, pumping fluid as the tube collapses. Such tubes may be able to act as effective &quot;on-board&quot; displacement pumps on smart microfluidic devices, removing the need for bulky pressure-driven syringe pumps. We finally show how the response times and flow characteristics in the tubes may be easily modified by varying the geometry or material properties of the hydrogel, allowing for faster response times in larger-scale devices and unlocking new possibilities for dynamic shape change."

    abstract: "<i>Preprint available on request</i><br/>Recent experiments have shown a rich variety of behaviour when soft, brittle, hydrogels are frozen, since it is found that water cannot freeze within the pore space of such materials, as a result of the Gibbs-Thompson effect. Hence, no ice forms within the hydrogel matrix, and pure ice grows by cryosuction, drawing water from the surrounding gel. The growth of this ice leads to deformation of the poroelastic gel, and drives interstitial flows in the nanoscale pores within the remaining dried hydrogel. In this paper, we model the formation of ice when hydrogels are cooled at a fixed surface, and investigate both the rate at which the ice grows and the elastic response of the gel that remains, explaining the steady states seen in experiments and the processes by which damage can be effected on the hydrogel. Understanding these freezing behaviours is vitally important if we are to comprehend the mechanisms behind damage to porous media such as asphalt road surfaces or human organs when they are frozen, and how to mitigate such effects."
