    abstract: "Thermo-responsive hydrogels are smart materials that rapidly switch between hydrophilic (swollen) and hydrophobic (shrunken) states when heated past a threshold temperature, resulting in order-of-magnitude changes in gel volume. Modelling the dynamics of this switch is notoriously difficult, and typically involves fitting a large number of microscopic material parameters to experimental data. In this paper, we present and validate an intuitive, macroscopic description of responsive gel dynamics and use it to explore the shrinking, swelling and pumping of responsive hydrogel displacement pumps for microfluidic devices. We finish with a discussion on how such tubular structures may be used to speed up the response times of larger hydrogel smart actuators and unlock new possibilities for dynamic shape change."

    abstract: "Recent experiments have shown a rich variety of behaviour when soft, brittle, hydrogels are frozen, since water cannot freeze within the pore space of these materials as a result of the Gibbs-Thompson effect. Hence, no ice forms within the hydrogel matrix, and pure ice grows by cryosuction, drawing water from the surrounding gel towards the phase boundary. The growth of this ice leads to deformation of the poroelastic gel, and drives interstitial flows in the nanoscale pores within the remaining dried hydrogel. In this paper, we model the formation of ice when hydrogels are cooled at a fixed surface, and investigate both the rate at which the ice grows and the elastic response of the gel that remains, explaining the steady states seen in experiments and the processes by which damage can be effected on the hydrogel. Understanding these freezing behaviours is vitally important if we are to comprehend the mechanisms behind damage to porous media such as asphalt road surfaces or human organs when they are frozen, and how to mitigate such effects."
