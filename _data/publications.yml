    notes: Self-oscillating gels are chemically-responsive hydrogels coupled to an oscillating chemical reaction of a stimulus solute. In response to the oscillating solute concentration field, responsive gels periodically swell and deswell, expelling their adsorbed water as they transition to a drier state, and reswelling once they return to a hydrophilic state. This volume phase transition occurs when the local stimulus concentration crosses a critical value...

    notes: Responsive hydrogels can sense environmental stimuli and respond as actuators by expelling water and changing shape. In this article, we develop theory to demonstrate that groups of responsive hydrogels can also communicate with each other, by utilising the effect of elastic deformation on chemical reaction dynamics. Specifically, we consider a system of two spatially-separated chemically responsive hydrogels...

    notes: Thermo-responsive hydrogels are smart materials that rapidly switch between hydrophilic (swollen) and hydrophobic (shrunken) states when heated past a threshold temperature, resulting in order-of-magnitude changes in gel volume. Modelling the dynamics of this switch is notoriously difficult, and typically involves fitting a large number of microscopic material parameters to experimental data. In this paper, we present and validate an intuitive, macroscopic description of responsive gel dynamics and use it to explore the shrinking, swelling and pumping of responsive hydrogel displacement pumps...

    notes: Recent experiments have shown a rich variety of behaviour when soft, brittle, hydrogels are frozen, since water cannot freeze within the pore space of these materials as a result of the Gibbs-Thompson effect. Hence, no ice forms within the hydrogel matrix, and pure ice grows by cryosuction, drawing water from the surrounding gel towards the phase boundary. The growth of this ice...

    notes: This thesis explores the behaviour of hydrogels, a broad class of materials comprising a hydrophilic polymer scaffold surrounded by adsorbed water molecules, potentially comprising over 99% water by volume. In general, hydrogels are soft, elastic, porous materials that can swell or dry to a significant degree by imbibing...

    notes: We investigate the formation of wrinkling instabilities at the interface between layers of hydrogel and water, which arise to relieve horizontal compressive stresses caused by either differential swelling or confinement. Modelling the gel using a linear-elastic-nonlinear-swelling approach, we determine both a criterion for marginal stability and the growth rates of normal modes. Furthermore, our formulation...

By modelling hydrogels as instantaneously incompressible, linear-elastic materials and considering situations in...

    notes: We introduce a new approach for modelling the swelling, drying and elastic behaviour of hydrogels, which leverages the tractability of classical linear-elastic theory whilst incorporating nonlinearities arising from large swelling strains. Relative to a reference state of a fully swollen gel, in which the polymer scaffold may only comprise less than...

    notes: Motivated by shallow ocean waves propagating over coral reefs, we investigate the drift velocities due to surface wave motion in an efectively inviscid fuid that overlies a saturated porous bed of fnite depth. Previous work in this area either neglects the large-scale flow between layers...

    notes: In his famous paper of 1847 (Stokes GG. 1847 On the theory of oscillatory waves. Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc. 8, 441-455), Stokes introduced the drift effect of particles in a fluid that is undergoing wave motion. This effect, now known as Stokes drift, is the result of differences between the Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities...

    notes: In a recent article, Ball and Huppert (J. Fluid Mech., 874, 2019) introduced a novel method for ascertaining the characteristic timescale over which the similarity solution to a given time-dependent nonlinear differential equation converges to the actual solution, obtained by numerical integration, starting from given initial conditions. In this article, we apply this method to a range of different partial differential equations...
