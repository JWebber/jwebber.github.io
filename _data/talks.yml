    abstract: "The formation of a wrinkled pattern on the surface of hydrogels as they are brought into contact with water and begin to swell is a familiar phenomenon discussed extensively in the literature, and leads to a wide array of behaviours as the gel continues to swell. The 'reticulated' wrinkle pattern can coarsen, crease, fold or even disappear entirely as more and more water is drawn in to the gel scaffold, but studies usually only focus on the criteria for the exchange of stability. In this talk, I introduce how a linear stability analysis for the onset of stability can be carried out in a poroelastic framework, with different mechanisms for patterning at different times.<br/><br/>

    At early stages, when only a thin skin on the surface of the gel is swollen, buckling occurs as a purely elastic phenomenon, with horizontal compressive stresses competing against anchoring from the base of the gel to form the pattern. This is then seen to smooth out at the same rate as the growth of the boundary layer, an observation that can be explained in terms of classical plate theory. At late stages, however, I show that wrinkling can only occur with volumetric change, and pattern formation is swelling-dominated. Understanding these two distinct processes allows us to describe observations of patterning made in experiments, including criteria for transient instabilities that disappear entirely as the gel approaches its steady, swollen, state."
