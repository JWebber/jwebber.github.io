## Teaching resources

Over the course of my PhD I supervised courses in applied mathematics as part of the [Cambridge Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad), as well as lectured portions of the Part IA Introduction to Mechanics course. I've collected some notes and resources here in case they're of any use.

### Part IB Methods and Variational Principles

### Part IB Fluid Dynamics
- [Notes on the stress tensor](assets/teaching/tripos/stresstensor.pdf) - though not on the course at Part IB, this justifies the boundary conditions introduced here.
- [Notes on water waves](assets/teaching/tripos/dbc.pdf), specialising in the dynamic boundary condition; people often find this hard.
- [MATLAB code](assets/teaching/tripos/q1_2019_17c.m) for a rough-and-ready visualisation of the flow field in the solution to 2019 Paper 1 Q17C.

### Part II Fluid Dynamics
- [Papkovich-Neuber potentials](assets/teaching/tripos/papkovichneuber.pdf) - again, not on the course, but useful solutions for Stokes flow.

### Part III introductory videos
I have produced a playlist of videos on YouTube introducing the basics of fluid mechanics and continuum mechanics in general for students who studied their first undergraduate degree elsewhere. [Click here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnSl0BDYTANR53RVje7BRHTvVlNsSnjrm&si=dZoDmcbt_rHS7Tix) to view all 10 videos on YouTube.
